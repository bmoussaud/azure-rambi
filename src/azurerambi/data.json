    "poster_description":"Against a comically chaotic digital landscape, a duo prominently features in the foreground: a quirky IT guy with a cheeky smirk, holding a giant laptop that's comically outdated, and his sidekick, a witty comedian, brandishing a stylishly impractical gadget. In the background, benign but exaggeratedly mischievous electronic devices hover with harmless intent while absurd digital effects pile humorously, hinting at the film's whimsical essence. The font at the top uses playful, bubbly letters, evoking a sense of fun and laughter."
